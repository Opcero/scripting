# to understand the following from the top of the pyramid to the bottom:
# iscsi will show m:\vd0, m:\vd1, m:\vd2 as different LUN blocks
# volume will show info about drive m:\
# virtualdisk will show info about the md0 the virtual disk
# storage pool will show info about st10-pool01 and, in this example in a mirror (raid 1) we then look to...
# physical disk to see id1 and id2 the two mirrored 'disks'
