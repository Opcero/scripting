# The iscsi target has already been configured
# we will cluster to file servers to a target iscsi server
to understand the following from the top of the pyramid to the bottom:
# iscsi will show m:\vd0, m:\vd1, m:\vd2 as different LUN blocks
# volume will show info about drive m:\
# virtualdisk will show info about the md0 the virtual disk
# storage pool will show info about st10-pool01 and, in this example in a mirror (raid 1) we then look to...
# physical disk to see id1 and id2 the two mirrored 'disks'

#    m\vd0  m:\vd1 m:\vd2
#           m:
#          md0
#       st10-pool01
#      --------------
#        |       |
#       --      --
#       id1     id2

# make note of target server's ip address
ipconfig

# note iSCSI qualified names (iqn) and CHAP authentication are configured under LUN mappings (in this example anyway).

##########
# connect two initiators (MS11A and MS11B) to the target
##########
# From server manager on the initiator: Tools > iSCSI Initiator, select the 'configuration' tab
# target initiator name is a fqdn and target is the ip address of the target
# enable multipath (multipath is required to attach multiple servers to same disks without causing conflicts)
# in advanced settings, enable CHAP (see linux server config for more details)

# useful commands if target won't connect
Get-WinEvent -Log Microsoft-Windows-iSCSITarget-Service/Admin
Restart-Service -Name WinTarget

# In server manager now go to File and Storage Services > Disks and configure the iSCSI disk
# right-click the disk and bring online
# right-click and create a volume

# do the same for the second initiator server.

############
# Configure Cluster
###########
# On the iscsi target server, open start > Windows administratove tools > Failover Cluster Manager
# select Validate configuration > next > add ms11a and ms11b
# system > uncheck list software updates
# system configuration > uncheck validate software update levels
# after this completes check the "Create the cluster now using the validated nodes" box.
# create a 'cluster name' CS11

# this cluster object must be granted permission to create computer object in ADUC.  Either per device or via delegate access
# per device below:
# open ADUC > view > advanced features
# expand the domain and right click Servers OU and select Properties (our cluster 'CS11' will be here with the two initiators)
# on the security tab select Advanced > add
# select a principal. select Object types , then check the box for Computers
# in Permissions check Create computer object.
