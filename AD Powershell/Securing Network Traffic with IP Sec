A.
# step 1 configure a certificate server (prefereably not a dc)
# step 2 confirm that all hosts that need certificates are properly enrolled to whatever internal website they'll use. Use KDC authentication certificate
# step 3 once this is accomplished we can now begin creating GPOs to require authentication for inound connections

B.
# gpo settings "<website name connection securiy policy (server)" to apply to server OU
Computer configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security > Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security > Connection Security Rules > right click to create new rule
# select isolation radio button
# select Require authentication for inbound connections and requestion authenticaiton for outbound connections
# select computer and user Kerberos V5
# select domain profile only

# verify that domain policy is present by navigating to servers windows defender and firewall > expand security associations > main mode (clients must have matching policy for IPsec to function)

# gpo settings "<website name> Connection security policy (client)"
# same as above but only request authentication for inbound and outbound connections

This authenticates communication at layer 3, but does not encrypt payload at the ssl/tls (layer 4).
# in the quick Mode setting it will show layer 3 encapsulation security but not ESP encryption

C. 
# to enable encryption edit the server GPO:
right click on Windows Settings with Advanced Security Settings > properties > IPSec Settings > customize > check 'require encryption for all connection security rules that use these settings'
